MindMapSuite Api Documentation

The MindMapSuite API allows users to get full access without using the site.
The usage of the API can be restricted with LDAP accounts or api-keys.
One need to configure this in the configuration file!

API usage examples:

The API values can be passed by POST and GET Parameters.
If the API is restricted by keys the parameter "key" must be used:

  api.php?key=keyone

If the API is restricted by LDAP accounts the "user" and "password"
parameters are used. Make sure that you have configured the ldap
settings right so that your user and password will match.

  api.php?user=foo&password=test

The api allows to "remote create" mindmaps with the so called "editkey".
The editkey is special and allows the reupload of a modified mindmap
by a client.
Loading Mindmaps is very easy. Please notice that the settings 
"inlinejavascript" and "inlinecss" are not affected because 
JavaScript and CSS Data are always transfered directly in the file.
