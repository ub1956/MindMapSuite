Requirements: 

- HTTP Server with PHP interpreter
- Cron 
  - some cronjobs are needed to clean the database regularly
- PostgreSQL or SQLite
  - one can also use a flatfile database (not recommend)

Installation:

The manual way:
- copy everything to your webroot
- run install.php script

The automatic way:
- run install.sh (sh install.sh /full/path/to/the/destination/directory)
- run install.php script


Supported webbrowser (native support):

- Internet Explorer 9
- Firefox versions since 2005
- Opera 8.0 and up
- Safari version since 2006
- Chrome version since 2006

Hints:

- There are several methods to increase page processing speed.
  Server side:
    - enable a PHP cache so that the script is cached
      (eAccelerator is recommend)
    - on busy system one can increase the speed by increasing
      the amount of webserver/php processes
  Client side:
    - by enabling the "one file" option in config.inc.php
      (this puts the whole css and javascript into the
       delivered html file and speeds up page processing
       up to three times.)
    - make the user use a webbrowser with a fast javascript-engine
      included. For instance "Google Chrome".
    - make the user use a webcache. This can decrease the load and
      processing-time of editable MindMaps (with MindEdit)  

- To increase the database read/write speed create the database
  in the memory of the computer and mirror it a few times a day 
  as needed. This will increase the read write performance of the
  database.
  
- If you want to use this project in a commercial environment feel
  free to contact me. We'll search for a proper solution.
  
- Send patches! Patches (especially those which are aimed to increase
  the speed) are appreciated!
